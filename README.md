# **DEEP-Q Snake**

This repository contains the implementation of the Deep-Q learning algorithm to play the famous game Snake, which is played using PyGame.

The used Neural Netwwork is quite simple but works fine: a 3-layer linear network. If left training enought time it is able to complete the entire game.
